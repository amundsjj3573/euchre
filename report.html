<li>You will create a website for a client of your choosing. Your client could be a family member, a business, a student group, a friend, an online community, and so on. The only restriction is that the client cannot be just you.</li>
I created my website for the unofficial Euchre club I am a part of.
<li>Your site must include some sort of header.</li>
The site has a header on every page that is not the home page, and the header is consistent throughout all pages on which it appears.
<li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose.</li>
My website has five pages: a home page, an about page, a members page, a how to play page, and a strategies page.
<li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.</li>
My website has navigation links, on the main page and in the headers of the other pages.
<li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens. For instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens. You are encouraged to implement separate layouts using CSS media queries.</li>
This was not completed, but the page looks fine on all sizes of screen.
<li>Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Global style rules must be placed in a shared stylesheet. Individual pages’ style rules must be placed in a separate stylesheets.</li>
There is a coherent style across the pages. Each page has the same background color and the contents pages have the same font and font size.
<li>Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.</li>
There are many relevant images across the pages, along with alts to explain the image.
<li>Each page must declare its favicon.</li>
There is a favicon (home made!)
<li>Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. CSS files must be placed in a directory named css. JavaScript must be placed in a directory named js.</li>
All files are organized as required.
<li>Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party tools.</li>
No libraries or framework is used.
<li>Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s HTML validator and CSS validator.</li>
All pages pass validation.
<li>Your site must be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with your instructor. On GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, share with the user twodee.</li>
This has been done.
<li>The names of your files should be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.</li>
All files are entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.
<li>Your site must be served out of port 8443.</li>
My site is served out of port 8443.
<li>Your site must be accessed only through HTTPS. You are encouraged to use Let’s Encrypt to obtain a free certificate.</li>
This has been done.
<li>Your content should be neatly aligned. The axes should be clearly visible.</li>
Content is either left aligned or left aligned within centered boxes.
<li>Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and copy in a serif font.</li>
There is a different font for the header and the content.
<li>Your site must include at least one form (or informal collection of input elements). The form might submit data to a server or invoke some client-side JavaScript function that alters the page. The action is not specified.</li>
There is a form with a submit button that does nothing.
<li>Your site must include links to external sites. Clicking on external links must open a new tab or window rather than replace your page.</li>
There are external links on the How To Play page hat open in a new tab when clicked.
<li>Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for classes and IDs.</li>
I made my code as readable as possible.
<li>Your site must include at least one animation, powered either by CSS or JavaScript.</li>
The header icons change color when moused over.

Feedback from my club:

The members of my club greatly enjoyed the page I made for us. The critiques that they had were that the background color can be a little distracting at times, that the page is a little blank still, and that I should add a page that a user can play Euchre on (I then explained how much time this would take to code).
