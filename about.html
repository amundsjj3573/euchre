    <h2>About us</h2>    
    
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      The Eau Claire euchre club was started unofficially by four friends in the summer of 2019, when Jonah, Holly, Morgan, and Alex spent an entire evening playing the game with each other. They realized that although they all found the game fun, what made is special is the friend group they were playing it with.
      
      They continued to play euchre together through the fall of 2019 until they discovered their friend Trevor also loved Euchre. During January of 2020 they played euchre together almost evey day. After this, it was only a matter of time before Lexy and Megan joined in in their games, creating the Eau Claire euchre club as we know it today

    <h3>House rules and club inside jokes</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>When a player goes alone, every point breakdown is doubled. So if the lone player gets 3 or 4 tricks, their team gets 2 points, if they get all tricks, they get 4 points, and if they get euchred the opposing team gets 4 points.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Light table talk is allowed. This makes the games more fun!</li>
      <br>
      <li>Jonah "Clubs" Amundsen - This came from a time where table talk went too far, and Jonah looked at his partner in the eye and said "clubs."</li>
      <br>
      <li>"You feelin' ballsy?" and also "Ya wanna get euchred?"- When Jonah and Trevor play together, they like calling trump on essentiall nothing. Often times they get euchered as a result.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Alex has a gambling addiction. This originates with Alex actually having a gambling addiction when they were a child, but now we joke about it whenever Alex makes a risky call, as they often do.</li>
