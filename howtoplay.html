    <h2>How to Play</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Euchre is a trick taking card game played with four. The game is played with the 9s, 10s, Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Aces from a standard deck of 52 cards. The players are divided into two teams of two, with the teams sitting opposite from each other at the table. A game of Euchre finished when one team reaches 10 points, with points being awarded at the end of each round. A round consists of two phases, a calling phase and a playing phase.</p>
    
    <h3>Calling</h3>
    
    <p>The calling phase begins with one player dealing five cards to each player. This will leave four cards undealt, which the dealer will put in front in themself on the table face down and flip the top card of the four face up. These four cards are called the "blind" or sometimes the "kitty".
    
    After this, the players, beginning with the player to the left of the dealer, declare whether they want the suit of the flipped card to be the trump suit of that round or not (this will make more sense after the explanation of the second phase) by saying "pass" or "pick up it".
    
    If any player says that they do want the trump suit to be the suit of the card that is flipped up, then the dealer picks that card up, puts it in their hand, and discards a different card to go in the blind (this card cannot be of the trump suit and no other player sees what card is discarded), and the second phase commences. If no player wants the trump suit to be the suit of the face up card, then the dealer flips that card back down and the players go around the table again.
    
    During this second pass around the table, a player can either declare a suit to be trump or pass on to the next player. If a player calls a trump suit, this suit cannot be the same suit as the card from the blind that was turned over. If no player wants any suit to be trump, the second phase is skipped and a new round begins with the next player as the dealer. Often the players will reveal their hands to each other and discuss why they had passed or if they were about to call anything.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Playing</h3>
    
    <p>The second phase of the round is when they players play their cards in rounds. The first round begins with the player to the left of the dealer and proceeds counterclockwise, with the dealer layin down their card last. The key rule of this phase is that the suit of the card that was played first (that was "led") has to be matched by the other players if they can. If the other players have none of the suit thsat was led, they are free to play any card they want. After each player lays a cards, they players determine which player won that trick (based on the rules in the next section).
    
    The player that won the first trick starts the second trick by laying the first card and therein setting a new "led suit" for the other players to follow, and play continues counterclockwise from them. This continues in this manner until all players have played all their cards.</p>
