She is one of the founding members of the UWEC Euchre Club. Holly grew up playing euchre with her family and it has been a joy to help teach how to play and share her love of the game with others! Her favorite part of Euchre Club is being able to spend time and create new memories with friends. One of her favorite memories from the 2019-2020 season was playing euchre on the cruise ship during the Blugold Marching Band’s 2020 trip to Australia and New Zealand.</p></div>

I’m a 21-year old Non-binary friend that studied at University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, but will soon be studying Anthropology and Japanese at the University of Alaska Anchorage! Jonah and Holly taught me how to play Euchre, and since I have an addiction to anything relating to cards I love it! My favorite part of Euchre Club isn’t really the actual game itself surprisingly, but rather the chaos and jokes that ensue!</p></div>

        <div class="about"><p>My name is Morgan Burke, and a second student at UWEC. My major is photography, with a minor in multimedia communications. I started playing Euchre my freshmen year after some of my friends taught it to me in the dorms. My absolute favorite part of Eurche club is the people, playing the game is fun, but really it's the people who make it what it is. Without them, it'd be much more bland and uneventful. My favorite memory from this past season of euchre club was when we were abroad on a cruise in New Zeland. I was playing with Holly, Jonah, and Trevor, and Holly was my partner. It was Jonah's turn to call a suit and while trying to figure out whether he should call it or not, he blatantly asked Trevor "Clubs?" It was the most blatant table talk I had ever heard, but it was also the funniest and most memorable thing to happen that night. In short, I love Eurche Club!! </p></div>
