    <h2>Strategies</h2>

    <ul>
      <b>Draw out trump</b>
      <li>If you are playing the first card of a round and you have the highest card of the trump suit that hasn’t been played, it is a good idea to play it. This forces your opponents to play any trump suit cards they have, paving the way for an easier win in later tricks, as well as guarantee your team one trick.</li>
      <br>
      <b>Lose the left</b>
      <li>Say you have many cards of the trump suit including the left trump and you are playing the first card of the first trick. The only problem is that you do not know where the right trump is. One way to tell where it is is by playing the left trump right away. This way, you will draw out trump cards from your opponents and discover the location of the right trump. If neither of your opponents plays the left trump, you know that either your partner has it or it is in the blind.</li>
      <br>
      <b>Make a void</b>
      <li>If you are ordered to pick up the card at the beginning of the round, there are strategies you can employ in discarding to make scoring more likely. If you have none of a suit in your hand, it is called having a “void” of that suit. The goal when discarding is almost always to create a void in a suit. This way, you will not be forced to follow suit if a player plays that suit and you will be more likely to take the trick with a trump suit. The exception to this rule is throwing away aces. If you are between throwing away an ace to create a void, and throwing away a lower card of a different suit without creating a void, usually it is recommended that you do not throw away the ace and pass on making a void.</li>
      <br>
      <b>Track the trumps</b>
      <li>Keep in mind as you are playing a round that there are seven cards of the trump suit. It is useful to remember which ones have been played and which ones have not. For example, if six of the trump cards have been played and you are holding the nine of the trump suit, you will definitely win that trick.</li>
      <br>
      <b>Pass the trick off</b>
      <li>This one is simple. If you ordered your partner to pick up the right trump and you are starting a round, play your lowest trump card with the intention that your partner will play the right trump to take the trick. This helps to draw out your opponents’ trump cards.</li>
      <br>
      <b>Lose low</b>
      <li>This one is more of a general guideline than a strategy. If you cannot possibly win the trick, play your lowest card possible. For example, if your opponent has already played the ace and you have the choice between playing the king or the nine, you should play the nine, as the king might help you win a future trick.</li>
      <br>
      <b>Trump low</b>
      <li>If you do not have to follow suit and you want to play a trump suit card to take the suit, don’t waste your high trump cards on this. Your high trump cards should be saved to beat other trump cards later in the round.</li>
      <br>
      <b>Let your partner take it</b>
      <li>This one is simple. If your partner is already winning a trick, do not take it from them. The exception to this is if you are not the last one in the round to play and you think that your opponent on your left can take it with their card. For example, if your partner started the round and played the 10, then your opponent to your right played the 9, then whatever your opponent on your left has will beat the 10. So if you have the ace of that suit, you should play the ace of that suit.</li>
      <br>
      <b>Keep them to one</b>
      <li>If your opponent calls a suit and you do not think you could possibly euchre them, you and your partner should not give up entirely. Instead, your goal should be to win a single trick and prevent your opponents from getting two points.</li>
      <br>
      <b>Hope your partner has one</b>
      <li>This is another guideline to follow when declaring a trump suit. If you call a suit, you should predict that your partner will take one trump, and so you only have to take two to win. This guideline is strongly supported by Holly in our euchre group.</li>
      <br>
      <b>Pass the trump, call the sister</b>
      <li>Let’s say that your opponent is the dealer and the jack of spades is face up. In your hand sits the jack of clubs and a few other lower trump cards. Having your opponent pick up the jack of spades is a bad idea, so you pass. After you everyone passes and the call is back to you. It is a good idea in this case to call clubs as the trump suit. You know that no one has the left trump as it was flipped over and put in the blind. So suddenly every club in your hand is more powerful!</li>
